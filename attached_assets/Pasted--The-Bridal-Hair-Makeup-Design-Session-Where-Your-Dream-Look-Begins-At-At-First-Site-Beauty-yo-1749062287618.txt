✨ The Bridal Hair & Makeup Design Session

Where Your Dream Look Begins

At At First Site Beauty, your bridal glam experience begins long before the big day. Our signature Bridal Hair & Makeup Design Session isn’t your average “trial” — it’s a luxury experience crafted to ensure your look is picture-perfect, timeless, and uniquely you.

Set in our private bridal suite inside Vata Salon, located in charming downtown Vancouver, Washington, your design session is where the magic begins. Here, our professionally trained artists collaborate with you to co-create your bridal look in a relaxed, attentive setting.

You’ll sit down with one of our expert stylists to walk through every detail of your vision — from texture, tone, and structure of your hairstyle to the glow, finish, and feature-enhancing artistry of your makeup. Your comfort is key. This is your moment to give feedback, explore styles, and make adjustments — nothing is off limits. Our goal? That you leave glowing with confidence, knowing your wedding look is perfectly dialed in.

But it doesn’t end there.

Once your look is designed, we ask you to wear it for at least six hours. Every two hours, we’ll have you snap photos — in natural light and with flash — to show us how your glam wears throughout the day. This feedback allows us to fine-tune every element, so when we arrive on your wedding day, we’re bringing flawless execution and peace of mind.

Your Look. Locked In.
By the time we arrive at your venue, every brushstroke, bobby pin, and blend has been tested and tailored. You'll also receive a personalized touch-up kit, complete with your lip color, blotting papers, and our professional-grade bridal setting spray — so your look stays radiant from “I do” to your last dance.

💄 Pro Tips for Timeless Bridal Glam

More is more (in photos): The camera tends to wash out color, so don’t be surprised if we recommend a little extra bronzer, blush, or lip definition than you’re used to. Trust us — it translates beautifully on camera.
Lashes are a must: Whether soft and romantic or bold and full, false lashes make your eyes pop and elevate the elegance of your final look.
Wear white to your session: This helps us see your makeup the way it will contrast against your gown.
Trust the wear test: Those photos you send us after your session? They're gold. They let us see if anything needs adjusting — like under-eye creasing, shine, or volume drop — before the big day.
