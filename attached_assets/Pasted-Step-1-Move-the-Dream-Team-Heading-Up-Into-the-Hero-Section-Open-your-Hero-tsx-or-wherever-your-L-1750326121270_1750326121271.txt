Step 1: Move the Dream Team Heading Up Into the Hero Section
Open your Hero.tsx (or wherever your “Luxury Bridal Hair & Makeup” section is located).

Inside that same section (with the background photo), add this just below the existing title/button:

tsx
Copy
Edit
{/* DREAM TEAM OVERLAY INSIDE HERO */}
<div
  ref={headerRef}
  className={`scroll-slow absolute bottom-[-60px] left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2 text-center z-30 transition-all duration-500 ${
    isHeaderOverPhoto ? 'text-white drop-shadow-lg' : 'text-gray-900'
  }`}
>
  <h2 className={`font-playfair text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold mb-4 transition-all duration-500 ${
    isHeaderOverPhoto ? 'text-white' : 'text-gray-900'
  }`}>
    Meet Your <span className={`transition-all duration-500 ${
      isHeaderOverPhoto ? 'text-blush-200' : 'text-blush-400'
    }`}>Dream Team</span>
  </h2>
  <p className={`text-lg leading-relaxed transition-all duration-500 ${
    isHeaderOverPhoto ? 'text-gray-100' : 'text-gray-600'
  }`}>
    With over 30 years of combined experience in the beauty industry...
  </p>
</div>
✅ This keeps the heading inside the photo area, not below it.

🔧 Step 2: Add Margin to Push the Bio Grid Lower
Now, in your About.tsx, remove the Dream Team heading block completely (it's now in the hero).

Then make sure the bio grid starts lower so the floating header has space to slide into view:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<section id="about" className="pt-[220px] bg-white">
  {/* Bio grid, trust section, etc. */}
</section>
You can tweak the pt-[220px] spacing based on how tall your hero image is. You want the grid to begin just after the overlay finishes animating.

🔧 Step 3: Optional: Add Gradient Fade Between Hero and Grid
To soften the transition:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<div className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full h-20 bg-gradient-to-b from-transparent to-white z-20"></div>
Place this at the very bottom of your hero section, just above the closing </section> tag.

✅ Result
Now:

Your Dream Team heading will scroll up from the hero photo and overlap the image.

It will transition seamlessly into the photo grid below, with no background cutoff.

The visual effect will match your earlier screenshots exactly.
